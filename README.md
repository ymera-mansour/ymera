# Ymera Project

## Current Status: ⚠️ Awaiting Content

This repository was created to process and test the YmeraRefactor project, but the uploaded zip file is currently empty.

## Quick Start

### Problem
The `YmeraRefactor.zip` file in this repository is 0 bytes and cannot be extracted.

### Solution
Please upload a valid zip file containing your project:

1. **Verify your local zip file**:
   ```bash
   # Check the file exists and has content
   ls -lh YmeraRefactor.zip
   
   # Test the zip file integrity
   unzip -t YmeraRefactor.zip
   ```

2. **Upload to GitHub**:
   - Delete the current empty YmeraRefactor.zip
   - Upload your actual project zip file
   - Or commit the unzipped project files directly

3. **Automated Processing**:
   Once a valid file is uploaded, the automated workflow will:
   - ✅ Extract all files
   - ✅ Organize the project structure
   - ✅ Review code quality
   - ✅ Run end-to-end tests
   - ✅ Generate a detailed report

## Project Structure (Expected)

Once the zip file is properly uploaded, we expect to find:
```
ymera/
├── YmeraRefactor.zip (or extracted contents)
├── README.md (this file)
├── INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md (current status)
└── [Your project files will appear here]
```

## Documentation

## Support

If you're experiencing issues:
1. Check that your zip file is not corrupted
2. Verify file size is greater than 0 bytes
3. Try extracting locally before uploading
4. Consider uploading extracted files directly instead of a zip
